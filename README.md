# AWS_SCALABLE_WEB_APPLICATION_DEPLOYMENT-
To ensure high availability and performance of any application on AWS using autoscaling and a load balancer is a approach of this project.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers multiple load balancing services to help distribute incoming traffic across multiple resources for improved availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.

We can create different target groups with different number of instances in it depending upon requirements. For ex: for online shopping application like myntra by analysing user traffic if there are less traffic on payment option then we can use less number of instances working for that target group particulary. Along with this if there is high traffic observed wishlist page or user login then we can effortlessly increase and use more instances for those target groups.


**STEP 1: CREATION OF TARGET GROUP**


**STEP 2: CREATION OF APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER**


**STEP 3: CONFIGURATION OF RULES IN ALB**


**STEP 4: EC2 INSTANCE LAUNCHING USING TEMPLATE WITH USER DATA**


**STEP 5: CREATE AUTO SCALING GROUP**

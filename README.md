
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers multiple load balancing services to help distribute incoming traffic across multiple resources for improved availability, fault tolerance, and scalability. Here are some key load balancing services provided by AWS:

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):
AWS Elastic Load Balancing service includes three different types of load balancers as follows:

a. Application Load Balancer (ALB):
ALB is a Layer 7 load balancer that operates at the application layer. It is ideal for routing HTTP/HTTPS traffic and provides advanced features like content-based routing, host-based routing, and integration with AWS WAF for web application security.

b. Network Load Balancer (NLB):
NLB is a Layer 4 load balancer that operates at the transport layer. It is designed to handle TCP and UDP traffic, making it suitable for protocols other than HTTP/HTTPS. It is used when you need ultra-high performance and low latency.

c. Classic Load Balancer:
The Classic Load Balancer is the legacy load balancer offered by AWS. It is a basic load balancer suitable for simple use cases but doesn't have all the features of ALB and NLB.
